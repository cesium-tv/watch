## development

Pull requests are welcome.

### running locally

This application can be run like most javascript / vue applications using the webpack development server. Just use the provided `Makefile` target to launch it.

```bash
$ make dev
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080/ in your browser of choice. In case port 8080 is in use, the development server will increment the port number. Check the console output to determine the port to use.
